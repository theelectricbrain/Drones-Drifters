# Drones-Drifters

### Project description ###
* This project aims to develop and open-source based software package performing
  hydrodynamic analysis from multiple drifters tracked and observed in temporally
  sequential aerial images (time-lapse stills and/or video) using off-the-shelf
  Use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
* The present package is still a work in progress, so the more feedback,
  the better.

### Applications ###
* The initial application is mapping temporally varying flow fields in open channel
  flow that occurs in tidal races and rivers.
* Potential use in open ocean flow environments.
* Transferrable applications for the core technology exist, as methods and code could be
  adapted to for calculating the velocity of several types of objects on land and/or at sea.

### Method ###
* Use UAVs to observe drifters released in flow.
* All drifters that are not planned to be recovered shall be biodegradable and preferably
  sourced from local produce.
* The size of drifter will be determined based on several factors including flight
  altitude and camera resolution.
* UAV position and camera orientation will be referenced to each image, and input to
  algorithms to determine scale, track drifter movement between sequential images, and
  calculate drifter velocities.
* Initial tests planed using UAV hovering at low altitudes, well known ground control
  points, and GPS units on board recoverable drifters to test and validate measurements
  from aerial images. 
* UAV based observations of large-scale flow features (jets, eddies and turbulent) will
  also be mapped from the images.
